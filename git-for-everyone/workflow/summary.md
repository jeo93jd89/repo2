# Summary

Following this simple workflow has helped keep my projects clean and `Git hell` free. I hope it serves you well too.

But ... the story doesn't end here. Well, the post does, but the story does not. There are many more advanced features that your team can use. I am sure some of you reading this will say "What about [rebasing](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Rebasing)?" This is a perfectly practical addition to this workflow and many teams use it. But out of all the teams I have ever worked for, only one has ever made use of this feature. Just saying.

Outside of that, for more in-depth learning on Git, I invite you to read the [Git book](http://git-scm.com/book/en), it's free and contains awesome learning.
