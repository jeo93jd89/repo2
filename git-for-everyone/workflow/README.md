# Git basics - a general workflow

There are many Git workflows out there, I heavily suggest also reading the atlassian.com [Git Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/workflows) article as there is more detail then presented here.

The two prevailing workflows are [Gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/workflows#!workflow-gitflow) and [feature branches](https://www.atlassian.com/git/workflows#!workflow-feature-branch). IMHO, being more of a subscriber to continuous integration, I feel that the feature branch workflow is better suited.

When using Bash in the command line, it leaves a bit to be desired when it comes to awareness of state. I would suggest following these instructions on [setting up GIT Bash autocompletion](https://gist.github.com/ivanoats/1823034).
